# RandMathFunction
It generates random math functions with different level of complexity.

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Evaluate the function when x doesn't appear. [Shutting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
- [ ] Draw the graph.

## A few bugs
arcsin(number>1) and arcsin( (function without x) > 1)  
arccos(number>1) and arccos( (function without x) > 1)  

## Compile
g++ main.cpp -o main  
./main
